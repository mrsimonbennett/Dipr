DIP for Methods in Laravel Controllers

Enabling you to use the IOC to inject into controllers methods. Why? Well somethings you have a instance of something you only want for one of a controllers methods so does not make sense to inject via the constructor.


```
 public function index( \ACME\Validation\Company $companyValidation)
    {    }
```
